# Tic Tac Toe
You may access the game at [here](https://adorawyne.github.io/tictactoe/).

## Project Description
Building this classic Tic Tac Toe game as my first personal project.

## Technologies Used
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Javascript
4. DOM

## Features
1. Score board to keep track of players' score.
2. Restart button to restart the game again.
3. Audio for clicking the game board and when there is a win or draw.
4. Hover effect on the game board and buttons.
5. Social media pages to follow if users want to. However, there's no link provided and when you clicked on the icon, it will direct you back to the game on a new page.
6. Put a favicon on browser tab.
7. The game can be played in Ipad or Iphone (smaller screen).


## Challenges Faced
The biggest challenges is always the first step: the plan on how to complete the project, breaking down the project into smaller tasks to complete.

I did the mockup of the webpage by hand-drawn first. Then targetted HTML, CSS, JS & DOM part by order.

Secondly, it would be the Javascript and DOM part. There are some repetitive code and hope I can modify the code to more DRY when my coding skill is more advanced. 

## Things I learnt from this project:
* More familiarise with the implication of HTML, CSS, Javascript and DOM in general.

### HTML
- Used semantic markup like main and footer to separate the main content and footer content.
- Used HTML table to build the score board.
- Used favicon to display the small icon on the tab.

### CSS
- Used grid and flexbox to layout the page and the content.
- Button default styling (words' color) has to be updated otherwise it will be shown on Iphone or Ipad.

### Javascript & DOM
- Utilised the knowledge learnt and put them together to build the functionality of the game.
- Learnt how to break the game into smaller part and tackled it one at a time:
    1. How to place the marker into each cell. 
    2. How to switch player.
    3. Setup the winning condition & draw condition.
    4. To keep track players' selection.
    5. Implemented the winning condition with the players.
    6. Displaying winning or drawing message.
    7. How to restart the game
    8. Playing the game again while the score board remains the players' score.
